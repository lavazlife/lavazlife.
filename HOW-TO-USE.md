## 💡 Pro Tips

### Make Your Profile Stand Out
1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "Python developer", say "Python developer specializing in automation and Android tools"
2. **Show, Don't Tell**: Link to actual projects that demonstrate your skills
3. **Keep It Updated**: An active profile shows you're actively developing
4. **Be Authentic**: Let your personality show while staying professional
5. **Think Like a Recruiter**: What would you want to see if you were hiring?

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Leaving profile incomplete or outdated
❌ No READMEs in repositories
❌ Pinning empty or unfinished projects
❌ Too much text, not enough visuals
❌ Broken links or images
❌ No clear call-to-action

### Quick Quality Checks
Before sharing your profile, verify:
- [ ] All images load correctly
- [ ] All links work
- [ ] No typos or grammar errors
- [ ] Profile looks good on mobile
- [ ] Pinned repos have good READMEs
- [ ] Recent activity shows active development

## 🎨 Customization Ideas

### Theme Consistency
All your stats currently use the "radical" theme. You can change this:
- Available themes: dark, radical, merko, gruvbox, tokyonight, onedark, cobalt, synthwave, etc.
- Change `theme=radical` to your preferred theme in README.md
- Keep consistent across all stat cards

### Badge Styles
Current badges use `for-the-badge` style. Alternatives:
- `flat`: Flat and simple
- `flat-square`: Flat with square edges
- `plastic`: 3D look
- `for-the-badge`: Current (recommended for headers)

### Layout Options
Experiment with different arrangements:
- Stack stats vertically instead of side-by-side
- Reorder sections based on what you want to highlight
- Add or remove sections as needed
